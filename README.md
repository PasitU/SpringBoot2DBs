# SpringBoot2DBs
<hr>
So this is pretty nightmarish since I spent 3 days on it.<br>
I basically use stuffs from the official <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.x/reference/html/howto-data-access.html#howto-two-datasources">springboot docs</a> along with a bunch of stackoverflow posts. <br>
So have fun reading those I guess.

## This was done on 8/8/2024, a week before sprint 1 begins and if I come to aware that this repository is leaked to other groups in this or the next sprint, I will be cursing your entire lineage as well as telling you to commit seppuku :boom::fearful::gun:.
